# Particle-Simulation
<p>Charged particles motion simulation in Earth magnetic field.
<p>Physical theories and equations for the simulation, simulation code and results are provided
<p>This simulation is just a part of my school project, hope it can help you
<p>I will keep it updated when I learn more about particle motion in magnetic field or plasma physics
